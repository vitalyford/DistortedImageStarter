# Distorted Image Assignment

In this assignment, you are given 2 Java classes (`ImageBuster` and `SimpleImage` in the `src` directory) that you are going to use to decode a `secret.png` image located in the `img` directory.

Your code will go in the `ImageBuster.java` file. Inside of that file, you will find your task at hand as well as the workflow to execute it. You can use `Eclipse IDE` to load the whole `DistortedImageStarter` project. Use `VS Code`, `Atom`, etc., only if you are familiar with them.
